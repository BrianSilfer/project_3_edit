# End to End Data

dropMembers: Serena Hollis, Katie Macys, Brian Silfer

Notes:
Choose one schema so that the work everyone does transfers

Project Objectives: 

Create an interactive dashboard using: 

A combination of web scraping and Leaflet or Plotly


A dashboard page with multiple charts that update from the same data


A server that performs multiple manipulations on data in a database prior to visualization (must be approved)


Project Questions:

The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.) 
Streaming services (at least 100 records in one file)


The questions you’ll ask of the data:

Did shows dropping on the service affect the stock prices? Line graph 

A general overlook of open and close prices.

Does Netflix experience changes (positive or negative) in its stock price?

Chart Ideas:

Heat Map of countries visualizing production
Stock line chart using 3rd party library to make chart interactive
CSS General style sheet, Yahoo Finance javascript plugin
